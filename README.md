# tried-calendar
A bit of context, this was for semester project that I completely procrastinated so i had roughly a few hours of work done into this.
Currently it only has a function of:

1. Being a Calendar
2. Memo function for a date(each date has different memory so you can have multiple memos on different dates)
3. WARNING! it doesnt save on closing the program :3    (yes its a feature :)
