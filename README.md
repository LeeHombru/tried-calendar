# tried-calendar
A bit of context, this was for semester project that I completely procrastinated so i had roughly a few hours of work done into this.
Currently it only has a function of:

1. Being a Calendar
2. Memo function for a date(each date has different memory so you can have multiple memos on different dates)
3. WARNING! it doesnt save on closing the program :3    (yes its a feature! :)

Sensei, if you read this, I procrastinated

使い方(how to use)
1.  アプリを起動をします。Start the App.
2. 日にちを選択してメモ機能利用できます。Select Date and use Note function.
3. 全機能利用しました。you have used all the functions.
4.  テッドトークにご覧いただいてありがとうございます。Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
